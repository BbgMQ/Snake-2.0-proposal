## 🎮 Game Design Concept 

Project Proposal Deliverable

🕹️ Level 1: Title & Hook :The title of this game will be snake 2.0 because it will be my version of snake

🕹️ Level 2: Choose Your Genre: arcade, single screen, up down left right , survival , endless , retro , speed reflexes. These fit the genre because of how snake is a single screen game where its endless until you die by running into yourself or the wall 

🎮 Core Genre:

📜 Scrolling / Perspective: single screen 

🧗 Movement & Abilities: up down left right 

⚔️ Action / Conflict: dying over and over when you hit the boundary or yourself

🏗 Structure / Progression:  keep making it further and further / progression over time

🎨 Aesthetic / Tone: retro and cartoonish 2 dimensional 

🧩 Challenge Style: speed reflexes and survival 

👉 After you’ve chosen your words, describe how your game fits this genre :These fit the genre because of how snake is a single screen game where its endless until you die by running into yourself or the wall 

🕹️ Level 3: Backstory:the history of this world is like the matrix. It appears happy and cartoonish but really it's just a means for trapping our character in a never ending game. We do not know how long this has been going on or who's doing this to our character but perhaps time will tell. Our character is the one and only character from my adaptation of the game snake. He was once a human but one day an unknown person with an unknown motive turned him into a cartoonish snake and trapped him in a fixed 2 dimensional box where he has been in the same monotonous cycle since the games release on the Nokia in 1997

🕹️ Level 4: Characters:the protagonist is the snake. He is a blue 2 dimensional cartoon styled snake. Despite being stuck in this prison for many years his hope and desire to escape have not faltered and he continues to look for a way to escape constantly. Perhaps if he manages to make it far enough before he respawns he just may escape… The antagonist is this prison he's trapped in. This cartoonish and happy world is designed to draw our characters' attention away from the fact that it is practically inescapable. The one thing our character knows is that he is alone here.

🕹️ Level 5: Target Market / Audience:: I think all age groups would enjoy the game as it will have the same mechanics as the original. Maybe the people who grew up in the 90s and are now adults will enjoy it more because of the nostalgia.

🕹️ Level 6: Player Motivations:What keeps the player playing is how with every highscore they get closer and closer to freeing our character and unraveling the mystery once and for all

🕹️ Level 7: Unique Selling Point (USP):What makes my version stand out is that there hasn't been a story created for this game and I think that makes it enticing 

🕹️ Level 8: Inspirations & Competition: A few games that I enjoy that are kind of like this game are minecraft and terraria. These games are similar in how they seemingly never end and don't have an ending. My idea would compete with minecraft because of how there is only one protagonist against the never ending world that traps them.

🕹️ Level 9: Goals: I hope the players feel enticed by the story and curious to see if they can escape
